      The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) has instructed all local government authorities in Luzon to evacuate citizens if necessary. They distributed humanitarian materials and other essentials in addition to the NDCC. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo also asked PAGASA to monitor the super typhoon every two hours and update its website.[21] PAGASA also cautioned all places with public storm signals to be prepared for storm surges, landslides, and flash floods. The Coast Guard issued a red warning for the whole country, indicating that the agency will be monitoring the entire country, particularly Northern and Central Luzon. All ferry terminals on routes from Luzon to Visayas and vice versa were shut down, and fishermen have been urged not to go out.

  <p style="margin: 25px 75px 75px 75px; font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px; color:white">Despite the fact that the Super Typhoon Parma was still too far away from making landfall in the northern Philippines, numerous modes of transportation were halted as the super typhoon approached. The province's electricity and communications were disrupted in Catanduanes, where the first signal warning no.3 was raised. The main highways were already littered with fallen trees. Approximately 30,000 households were forced to flee. More than 2,000 people were stuck at ferry ports, in addition to the Bicol region.[36] 39 provinces, including Metro Manila, were placed under signal warnings, with each location experiencing enormous rainfall and severe winds. Parma made landfall around 3:00 p.m. PST/7:00 a.m. EDT in Northeastern Cagayan (UTC). At least 6,036 individuals were impacted in 39 barangays (villages) in Cagayan, with P20.33 million worth of agricultural produce lost.
